Hi, I'm Sebastian Kulle. I bridge the gap between complex industrial data and human understanding. As a Scientific Researcher at the Fraunhofer FFB, I explore how Digital Twins in the built environment can evolve from static data containers into interactive narratives.
My research focuses on "Human-Centric Building Data Stories." By combining methods from Architecture, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Software Engineering, I develop frameworks that reduce cognitive overload and empower decision-makers in the age of the Digital Factory.
